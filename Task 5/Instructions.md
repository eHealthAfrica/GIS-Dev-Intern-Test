## Additional Instructions

1. The API at [REST COUNTRIES](https://restcountries.eu/) should be used to fetch the list countries in the Africa continent.

    a. Information regarding the timezones and coordinates of the country can be gotten from the response gotten from the [REST COUNTRIES](https://restcountries.eu/) endpoints.
